# Selling-Price-Prediction 
This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a used car  price prediction website. First build a model using sklearn and random forest regressor using cars dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html that allows user to enter year, showroom price,  kilometres Drived, number of owners previously had etc  and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, feature engineering, , randomized search cv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1.	Python
2.	Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.	Matplotlib for data visualization
4.	Sklearn for model building
5.	Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and Spyder as IDE
6.	Python flask for http server
7.	HTML for UI
